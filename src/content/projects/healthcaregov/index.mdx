                <p>Plan cards are the primary tool consumers use to assess and compare available plans on HealthCare.gov. Health insurance literacy is universally low and there are often 100+ plans with dozens of benefit/cost attributes to consider.</p>
                    
                <p>Users were often reaching a point of frustration and exhaustion while plan shopping, giving up, and “settling” for a plan. The potential for negative health and financial outcomes due to suboptimal plan selection is significant. So...</p>
                
                <blockquote class="bg-lightBlue text-white border-none rounded-md p-6 my-16 font-normal not-italic"><strong>How might we</strong> clarify the essential differences between plans, making them easier to compare, and remove friction from the path between the consumer and a plan that meets their unique needs?</blockquote>
                
                <h2>First Steps</h2>
                <p>First we needed to understand  how real consumers were using plan cards, both in isolation and as part of their entire plan shopping journey. Based on our own heuristics audit and knowledge of UX best practices, we had a series of assumptions about the issues affecting the plan cards.</p>

            <h2>Research, Analytics, and Call Centers OH MY!</h2>
            <p>Uncovering research and data-validated consumer frustrations and pain points was essential to ensure we addressed the right problems and didn’t succumb to our own blindspots and biases. Fortunately, we had a wealth of past research and data to analyze, synthesize, and translate into specific requirements and problems to be solved. This included:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Years worth of user research conducted by CMS’ Division of Research</li>
                <li>Analytics data from multiple sources, tracking interaction with all aspects of the plan cards</li>
                <li>Aggregated feedback, questions, and complaints for consumers calling CMS call centers</li>
                <li>Site-wide and page-specific surveys driving a user pain index and log of comments and complaints</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Stakeholder Engagement</h2>
            <p>While CMS’ Office of Communications is our primary stakeholder, representatives from several other arms of the agency were heavily involved throughout this process, providing subject matter expertise and guidance along the way. We led a group of over 40 stakeholders through a series of collaborative UX workshops to ensure our solutions aligned with the many business needs of CMS.</p>

            <h2>Primary and Secondary Decision Making</h2>
            <p>Plans are made up of over 100 individual benefit/cost attributes, but there are generally just a few pieces of cost information that serve as primary decision points for consumers. Monthly premium, deductible, out of pocket max, and estimate total yearly cost are the clearest indicators of how much a plan will actually cost. If those costs for a given plan don’t resonate with the consumer, the many other costs and benefits of the plan are unlikely to attract their attention or consideration.</p>
            
            <blockquote class="bg-lightBlue text-white border-none rounded-md p-6 my-16 not-italic"><strong>The plan:</strong> Establish a visual hierarchy that clarifies the primary attributes, making it easier to quickly scan the page and identify which plans have potential, then provide a means of exploring the next level of cost information.</blockquote>
